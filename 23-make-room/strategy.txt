  Start:       Move cost:
               A=1
  ...........  B=10
    A C C D    C=100
    B D A B    D=1000

                   A can move left and right, since
   ...........     Both directions allow A to go to
     A C C D       the end position when B is gone.
     B D A B       

An amphipod can move once out of a room and once back into
a room. There are 8 amphipods. That means that worst case, 
16 moves are required to move all amphipods to their
respective rooms.

The maximum number of options for movement are possible at
at the start of the game

The possible moves are:

   AA.A.A.A.AA    Possible options for A 
     * C C D       
     B D A B       
                   
   CC.C.C.C.CC    Possible options for C 1
     A * C D     
     B D A B       

   CC.C.C.C.CC    Possible options for C 2
     A C * D     
     B D A B       
                   
   DD.D.D.D.DD    Possible options for D
     A C C *     
     B D A B       

If we'd be able to do this many moves (28) on every turn, then
solving this recursively would be madness with 28**16 moves over
all steps. Lucky, there are rules that quicly limit the number
of options after the first move. For example, if we started with:

   .....A.....   
     . C C D     
     B D A B    

then the options for moves on the second turn would be:

   BB.B.A.....  (where one B will block A from returing
     . C C D     to its room, so that's a dead route)
     * D A B

   .....A.C.CC   
     . . * D     
     B D A B    

   .....A.D.DD   
     . C C *     
     B D A B    

In total, there are now 9 options. This makes things less worse
for doing recursion. 

The illegal move for B from above might be a good one to detect early,
to stop recursion on that route.

Another thing that limits the recursion is having a score to work
against. When a score has been settled, any recursion route that exceeds
the score can be stopped immediately.

All in all, it feels like a recursive solution might work here. A depth
first route would allow for finding a score to work against early on.

Yeah, let's go for this.
