Using the deterministic die
===========================

3 rolls each time, 3 consecutive numbers
So a good way to generate total scores would be:

- turn n = 0 at start
- previous turn t = 0 at start
- current turn x = ((sum of all numbers up to n = n*(n+1)//2) - t) % 100
- t = current turn
- n = n + 1
