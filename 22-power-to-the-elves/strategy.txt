Part 1
======

Go for brute force. Shouldn't be too big of a problem for a 100x100x100 space.


Part 2
======

Ouch... brute force will never work, so a better algorithm is required.

What might work is treating the steps as adding actual shapes to the grid.
When there's an overlap with an existing shape, then I could split the overlapped
shape into multiple shapes, dropping the part that is overlapped.
After splitting, an off state shape can be dropped, since it's the default state.
In the end, the size of the on shapes can be summed up to find the answer.
